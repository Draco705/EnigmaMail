Hey Colton,

This is the second test message.  In order to make this file, I had to clone the GitHub
repository onto my VM.  Then after that I had to run the Makefile again to create
executables that were compiled and ready to run on the Linux VM.

There was an issue with compiling and creating the executables on the Mac OS X operating
system where they would run on the Linux VM, so I tried putting all the files on the VM
first and then compiling them and making new executables on the VM.  I will try running
the script on these new executables and see if we can get this thing working properly!

Best,
Colton
